Hi there! ðŸ‘‹
Iâ€™m a passionate and curious learner who enjoys exploring new topics and challenges. ðŸš€

ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m proficient in Python, one of the most versatile and popular programming languages.
ðŸŒ± I have also completed a cyber security course where I learned about the fundamentals of cryptography, network security, and ethical hacking.
ðŸ“š Iâ€™m currently working on some exciting projects that I plan to showcase on my GitHub profile soon. Some of them involve web development, pentesting and SQL.
ðŸ’¬ I love to share my knowledge and experience with others and Iâ€™m always open to feedback and collaboration.
ðŸ“« If you want to know more about me or my projects, feel free to reach out to me anytime. Thanks for reading!
