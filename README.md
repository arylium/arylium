I am a curious and creative person who enjoys learning new things and solving problems. I have a passion for technology and programming, especially in the field of cyber security. I have completed a cyber security course where I learned how to protect data and systems from malicious attacks. I can use Python to write scripts and automate tasks. I am currently working on some exciting projects that will showcase my skills and challenge me to grow as a developer. I am always looking for opportunities to improve myself and collaborate with others who share my interests.
